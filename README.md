Cake Bliss Website Overview:
Cake Bliss is a beautifully designed, fully responsive bakery website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase a wide range of cakes, pastries, and desserts. 
The website’s main goal is to deliver a delightful user experience that mirrors the sweetness and elegance of the brand itself. 
It includes sections such as Home, About Us, Menu, Gallery, Testimonials, and Contact, making it easy for visitors to explore the bakery’s offerings. 
The Home page features a captivating hero banner with a mouthwatering cake image and a catchy tagline that immediately grabs attention. 
The About section tells the story of Cake Bliss—how it began, the passion behind baking, and its commitment to quality ingredients.

From a design perspective, the website leverages advanced CSS styling such as smooth transitions, hover effects, and parallax scrolling to create an engaging and modern aesthetic. 
The Menu page uses a neat card layout to display different cakes with images, names, and prices. 
The Gallery section includes a lightbox effect using JavaScript, allowing users to click and enlarge images for a closer look. 
JavaScript is also used to add interactivity, such as an animated navigation bar, scroll-to-top button, and a dynamic review slider on the testimonials section.

On the technical side, HTML provides the structure with semantic tags for better SEO and accessibility, CSS handles the visual presentation using grid
and flexbox for layout alignment, and JavaScript brings life to the site with animations and form validation. As a side topic, 
this project helps beginners understand front-end development fundamentals, responsive web design principles, and how user interface design impacts customer engagement.
Future enhancements can include backend integration for online orders or a login system for loyal customers, expanding Cake Bliss into a fully functional bakery e-commerce platform.
